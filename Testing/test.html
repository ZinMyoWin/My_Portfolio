        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dynamic and highly motivated software engineering student currently enrolled in Level 4 Pearson Higher National Diploma in Computing at Lithan Educlaas. With a strong passion for technology and a deep-seated curiosity for all things related to software development, I have cultivated a versatile skill set that encompasses front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and React JS, as well as back-end frameworks such as Spring Boot and Java. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, both technically and professionally, and I am excited about the prospect of applying my knowledge and skills to meaningful projects in a collaborative team environment. My ability to blend development expertise with proficiency in software development life cycle (SDLC), wireframing, prototyping, and flowchart creation makes me a valuable asset in delivering holistic software solutions.
